# Sign-Up-Form

This project is a comprehensive signup form developed using HTML. The form consists of six entries:

- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone number
- Password
- Confirm Password

### Features

- **Form Validation**: The form comes with inbuilt validation. If a user submits the form with one or more incorrect or incomplete fields, the erroneous entries will turn red, visually indicating that they need correction. They will remain highlighted until the user has corrected the entries.

- **Hover Effect**: Each input field in the form has a specific hover color effect. This enhances user experience by giving immediate visual feedback when an input field is active.

- **Aspect Ratio Support**: The form is designed to support multiple aspect ratios, ensuring it displays correctly across a variety of screen sizes and resolutions. However, it does not support mobile aspect ratios at this time.

- **Password Requirements**: The password field has specific requirements to enhance security. The password must be at least 10 characters long, contain at least one numeric character, one alphabetic character, and one special character. The form will not accept passwords that do not meet these requirements.

- **Password Confirmation**: To prevent typographical errors, users are required to enter their chosen password twice. The form will not be successfully submitted unless the password and confirm password fields match exactly.

### Usage

After filling out the form, click the submit button. If any fields are incorrect or incomplete, they will be highlighted in red. Hover over an input field to see the hover color effect.
